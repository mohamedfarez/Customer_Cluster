# K-Means Clustering Project

### Author: Mohamed Fares

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of K-Means clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into distinct clusters. It consists of two main files:

1. **try2-k-mean.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that contains the Python code used to apply the K-Means algorithm.
2. **K_mean.pkl**: A pre-trained model file where the K-Means model is saved using Python's `pickle` library for future use.

## Files Description

- **`try2-k-mean.ipynb`**:  
  This notebook includes:
  - Data preprocessing steps.
  - Applying the K-Means algorithm to group data into clusters.
  - Visualizing the results of clustering.
  - Evaluation of the model performance.

- **`K_mean.pkl`**:  
  This file is the serialized version of the trained K-Means model. It allows you to reload the model and use it for making predictions on new data without the need to retrain the algorithm.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git
    ```
   
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. To view and run the code, open the Jupyter Notebook `try2-k-mean.ipynb`:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook try2-k-mean.ipynb
    ```

4. The `K_mean.pkl` file can be used to load the pre-trained K-Means model for prediction. Example code to load the model:
    ```python
    import pickle

    with open('K_mean.pkl', 'rb') as file:
        kmeans_model = pickle.load(file)

    # Use the model for predictions
    predictions = kmeans_model.predict(new_data)
    ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (specified in the notebook or `requirements.txt`)
